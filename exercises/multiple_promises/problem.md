# Can you do what `async` does?

When doing asynchronous programming you will often want to perform multiple
operations in parallel. In some cases you may wish to delay further processing
until a list of async operations have completed.

In synchronous code this is trivial because our operations are executed in the
order they are specified:

```js
var thingOne = getThing(1);
var thingTwo = getThing(2);

combine(thingOne, thingTwo);
```

We would like to build a function such that we can specify a list of
asynchronous values we would like to fetch and then use once all are
available.

```js
getAll(fetch(1), fetch(2))
  .then(function (values) {
    console.log(values[0], values[1]);
  });
```

## Task

Letâ€™s build this function!

Create a function `all` that accepts two promises as arguments. This `all`
function should do all of the following:

Create an internal promise in whatever way you see fit.

Create a `counter` variable with initial value of 0.

Attach `then` fulfillment handlers to both promises and increment the internal
counter when the handlers are called.

When the counter reaches 2, fulfill the internal promise with an array
containing **both** values.

Finally return that internal promise to the user.

After you finish writing your `all` function, pass `getPromise1()` and
`getPromise2()` into your new function and then attach `console.log` as a
fulfillment handler to the promise returned by your function. These two
promise-returning functions will be provided to you in the global scope.

## Hint

You probably want to use the good old Promise constructor. If you do find some
other way, please [file an
issue](https://github.com/stevekane/promise-it-wont-hurt/issues); Iâ€™m
interested in such a solution!

To those of you who are already familiar with ES2015 promises, you might
notice that this task is similar to what `Promise.all` can do. Rest assured
that `Promise.all` is disabled in this lesson ðŸ˜ˆ
